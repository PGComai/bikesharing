# bikesharing

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to summarize Citibike rider data from NYC to present to investors who will hopefully fund a bikeshare startup in Des Moines, Iowa. The data are from the Citibike website and cover the month of August 2019. I used Tableau to gather insights about popular ride times, user demographics, individual bike usage, etc. A Tableau story containing the results of this analysis can be found at the link below.

## Results

### At a glance:

- 8 am & 5 pm are peak ride times (fig. 1)
- Weekends see less sharp demand spikes
- Demand is similar for men and women
- Users who do not subscribe to the Citibike service account for less predictable demand
- Ride duration is consistent throughout the day and across gender
- Some bikes see more miles than others, which can be tracked for maintenance purposes

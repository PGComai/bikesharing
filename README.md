# Analyzing rideshare data from Citibike users in NYC

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to summarize Citibike rider data from NYC to present to investors who will hopefully fund a bikeshare startup in Des Moines, Iowa. The data are from the Citibike website and cover the month of August 2019. I used Tableau to gather insights about popular ride times, user demographics, individual bike usage, etc. A Tableau story containing the results of this analysis can be found at the link below.

## Results

### At a glance:

- 8 am & 5 pm are peak ride times (fig. 1)
- Weekends see less sharp demand spikes (fig. 2)
- Demand is similar for men and women (fig. 2 & 3)
- Users who do not subscribe to the Citibike service account for less predictable demand (fig. 4)
- Ride duration is consistent throughout the day and across gender (fig. 5 & 6)
- Some bikes see more miles than others, which can be tracked for maintenance purposes (fig. 7)

## Summary

Two additional visualizations I would add:
- Mapping the routes of the bikes most in need of maintenance
- Mapping ride duration according to starting location

While these findings will not translate perfectly from NYC to Des Moines, we now have good information regarding the use of rideshare bikes. I believe the most important conclusion to draw is that bike usage hugs the workday, with peaks during commute hours. This is only true for subscribed users, which tells us that our strategy should change depending on whether we look to target a subscription model or a pay-per-ride system. A smooth launch is important for a startup, so this data will allow us to predict the times and locations of peak demand and distribute bikes accordingly.
